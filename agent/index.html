NAVIS is a Portuguese company whose mission is the internationalisation of the Iberian economy and intermediate import and export exchange of goods.<br><br>
 
Portugal and Spain are legendary lands. Since the beginning of time they have achieved recognition for their cultural richness, art, technological progress and entrepreneurship, found everywhere. It is not by chance that it was in this region that globalization thrived.<br><br>
 
Today, as in the past, we have much to give the world. But for that, we make an appeal:<br><br>
 
That all those who want to venture in a business that is different and potentially very profitable, do so by joining Navis in disclosing and selling the Iberian economy. Furthermore in navis you can archieve a platform to export goods for your country to europe.<br><br>

We are looking for commercial agents for this mission. The function of the agents is, with the utmost independence, even if temporarily, carry out the following tasks<br><br>
1.	Identify business opportunity – in any sector of the economy- of  a vast range of Iberian products,<br>
2.	Seek contacts in order to create interest, <br>
3.	Achieve sales,<br>
4.	Follow-up on the merchandise delivery process to the destined markets,<br><br>

NAVIS will give all the necessary support to the merchandise sales and transport process, committing itself to mediate in all operations.<br><br>

The agents’ payoff will depend solely on their performance. The agent will receive attractive commissions based on a percentage of the sales.<br><br>
  
If you are interested, please feel free to contact us for additional information.<br><br>
 
Should this not be the right moment for you, but you know someone who might be interested in this venture, you may pass on this message.<br><br>

If your contacts lead to a new Navis agent, and if that agent gives your name as the referring person, just for that, you will gain a 3% commission on the first sale mediated by the referred agent.<br><br>
